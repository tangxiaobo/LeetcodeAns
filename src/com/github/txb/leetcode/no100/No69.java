/**
 * NO.69. Sqrt(x)
 *
 * Implement int sqrt(int x).
 * Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
 * Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 4
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
 *              the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
